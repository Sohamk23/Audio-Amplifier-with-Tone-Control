1.Amplification Stage:
Connect Pin 1 of the first LM386 to the input source.
Set the gain using resistors between Pin 1 and Pin 8 of the first LM386

2.Bass Control:
Connect Pin 2 of the first LM386 to a bass control potentiometer.
Use an RC filter between Pin 2 and Pin 5 to control the bass frequency.

3.Treble Control:
Connect Pin 2 of the second LM386 to a treble control potentiometer.
Use an RC filter between Pin 2 and Pin 5 to control the treble frequency.

4.Output Stage:
Connect Pin 5 of the second LM386 to the positive terminal of the speaker.
Connect Pin 4 of both LM386 ICs to the negative terminal of the speaker.

5.Power Supply:
Connect Pin 6 of both LM386 ICs to the positive side of the power supply.
Connect Pin 3 of both ICs to the ground of the power supply.

6.Testing:
Connect the input source and power up the circuit.
Adjust the potentiometers to control bass and treble.
Verify the amplified audio output through the speaker.
