LM386 Op-Amp: 
LM386 is a versatile and widely used audio amplifier IC. It operates with a low supply voltage, making it suitable for battery-powered applications

Amplification Circuit:
Connect Pin 2 of the LM386 to the input audio signal.
Use a resistor network to set the gain according to your requirements.

Tone Control:
Use the first LM386 for bass control and the second for treble control.
Implement a simple RC filter network for each tone control. Adjusting the potentiometers will alter the cut-off frequencies, thereby controlling the bass and treble.
